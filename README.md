# Drink Water

https://thedanitor.github.io/drink_water/

This project is from the Day 16 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have heavily commented the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what each line of code does.

### Overall Impression

Good visual example of DOM manipulation. Good refresher on how to use math formulas to make site interactive.

### Things Learned

* Can specify border-radius for all 4 corners
* There is a contains() method on classList() 
* nextElementSibling property will get the next sibling element
